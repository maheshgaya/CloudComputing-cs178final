Drake University Final CS178 project. Contributors: Mahesh Gaya, Alexis Kulash, Jennifer Steffens.
This was our final project for CS178. It was targeted to Drake University Students. 
In this project, users can search for volunteer programs to participate.
The administrators could edit or add a new program into the system.
The project was written in HTML, CSS, and PHP. We used MySQL for our database.
