	  <h3>Drake values the opportunity to work with local neighborhoods and community organizations.</h3>
	  <p>Annually, Drake partners with over 100 community agencies and schools on a variety of projects from lunch hour reading programs with kids at King Elementary to building houses with Habitat for Humanity. Whether you are seeking a one-time opportunity to serve a local organization or looking to make an ongoing commitment to an organization or cause you are passionate about, we can connect you. Community partners rely on the goodwill of volunteers to sustain their work. Plenty of opportunities to serve one time, one semester, or even a whole year exist. Many organizations we partner with also offer student volunteers the flexiblity of choosing their own scheduling. Whether you are looking to volunteer as an individual or with a group of friends or colleagues, these opportunities will provide you the chance to give back to the community and fulfill the needs of a local organization. Whatever your interest, there is an opportunity for you to get involved!</p>

	  <h3>Students: Looking to make friends and engage with the community?</h3>
	  <p>Over the course of the year, Drake University sponsors and supports various community-wide events and initiatives such as the Iowa State Fair, Principal Charity Classic, Juneteenth, and more. We also support national, established organizations, such as the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross. Each of these events and organizations requires the assistance of faculty, students, alumni, and friends of the university who are willing and eager to represent Drake values to the community. Previous volunteer experience or knowledge of the organization, event, mission, or cause is not required.</p> 

	  <h3>Organizations: Want to connect with hundreds of Drake student volunteers?</h3>
	  <p>With more than 5,000 students in over 100 majors on campus, there are endless opportunities to find interested student volunteers. Many clubs and organizations organize community service and advocacy projects that are open to the entire campus. Serving alongside students helps you to build relationships with the Drake community while fulfilling a local need.</p>
